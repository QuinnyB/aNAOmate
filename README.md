`aNAOmate` is an web-based interface for controlling SoftBank's Aldebaran Nao (V5/V6) robots.

## Start and Connect to Robot

To connect to the robot:

2. Plug in an ethernet cable to the robots head to ensure that it is on the same local network as the laptop.
3. Push and hold the button on the front of the robots to power on.
4. Once robot is awake (it will make a wake-up sound), push the button twice to relax the robot into a safe resting position.
5. Push the front button once to get the name of the robot and the IP address.
6. Navigate to this IP address on the laptop (which is on the same network)
7. Log in to the robot admin with admin credentials (nao/nao).
